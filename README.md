## Development 

### Methodology

The project was developed using a Kanban board in Trello. The board is in my native Polish, since I was the sole developer, and the requirements were formulated in this language as well.

The board consisted of 5 columns:

* Backlog — stories to be started, based on the requirements received from the recruiter
* Requirements — the stage where the task went through some brainstorming and visualisation
* Coding — actual programming
* Test — verifying if everything works as expected, including border cases; in this case, also adding Storybook files & tests
* Done — the task is completed

### Technologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:

* React as the main framework
* Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI for the user interface components
* Storybook for unit tests & automated docs
* GitHub for version control

## Features

By 'features' I mean the way that the requirements were handled.
